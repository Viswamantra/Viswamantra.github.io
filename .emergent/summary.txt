The AI engineer successfully initiated the SheshA app, later rebranded to OshirO, transforming it from a basic idea into a functional marketplace. Key development phases included setting up core authentication (mock phone/email OTP), implementing a dynamic tab-based navigation for Customer, Merchant, Offers, Admin, and QR Code generation, and integrating mock payment systems (UPI/QR). The backend, built with FastAPI and MongoDB, supports these features, including revenue tracking and analytics for the Admin panel. Challenges primarily revolved around frontend navigation complexities (shifting from React Navigation to Expo Router's file-based routing with custom tabs) and resolving dependency/JSX errors. The current focus is on fixing a recurring  import error and a missing  asset, demonstrating a persistent commitment to stability before further feature development.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an app named SheshA (later OshirO), similar to nearwala.com, offering Food, Clothing, and Beautician spas. It needs location-based alerts for Android users, with a contact number of +9182653234 (later updated to +917386361725). Key requirements include:
-   **Location-based services**: Alerts when users move, specific radius filtering, real-time location, driving directions, and estimated travel time.
-   **User/Business Management**: Business owners can register and add services/offers. User preferences for service types (Food/Clothing/Spa).
-   **Authentication**: Phone number verification (initially requested as Twilio, then mock OTP), email verification (mock OTP).
-   **Offers & Discounts**: Offers tab for customers and merchants to display business photos, existing, and instant discounts for OshirO users.
-   **Monetization**: 2% revenue share on total sales credited to the OshirO app team.
-   **Payment Processing**: Secure and instant payments via UPI and QR code (Razorpay, Paytm, PhonePe mock integration, direct bank transfer to specified number). QR code scanning for payments.
-   **Communication**: WhatsApp integration for instant discount notifications (free/mock service only) to +917386361725.
-   **Admin Panel**: Access for the OshirO team only to track purchases, discounts, sales data, revenue, and manage customers/merchants.
-   **Branding**: App name changed from SheshA to OshirO, and contact number updated to +917386361725.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo React Native frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   ****: The FastAPI backend, managing API endpoints for user authentication, business registration, offer management, mock payment processing, WhatsApp notifications, and admin functionalities (analytics, revenue tracking). It interacts with MongoDB.
-   ****: The main entry point for the Expo Router frontend, responsible for rendering the  and  which contains the main application logic and navigation.
-   ****: Handles user login/registration with mock phone and email OTP verification.
-   ****: Manages initial user setup and preferences, leading to the main app.
-   ****: The core navigation component, implementing a custom horizontal tab bar to switch between , , , , , and . It also manages logout.
-   ****: Displays content and features relevant to a customer, including service discovery and payment initiation.
-   ****: Provides a dashboard for merchants to register their business, manage services, create offers/discounts, and access basic analytics.
-   ****: Dedicated screen for displaying and managing business offers and discounts.
-   ****: Handles payment initiation, QR code generation for UPI, and QR code scanning.
-   ****: A protected screen for the OshirO team to view analytics, track revenue (2% share), and monitor customer/merchant activity. Access is via a specific key.
-   ****: Generates QR codes for customer and merchant registration links.
-   ****: Manages user profile settings.
-   ****: Provides authentication context throughout the frontend, managing user state and login/logout actions.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate a real email service for OTP verification (SMTP, SendGrid, or Resend).
-   Integrate a real WhatsApp service for discount notifications (currently mock/free).
-   Implement real payment gateway integrations (Razorpay, Paytm, PhonePe) instead of mock.
-   Implement real-time location updates for users.
-   Implement driving directions and estimated travel time for merchants.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging frontend errors. The app was attempting to bundle after recent additions of Payment and Admin screens, along with their integration into the main navigation. The user reported two concurrent errors:
1.  ****: This error originated in  at line 39 and later line 42, indicating that despite a previous attempt to add the import, the component was still not correctly recognized or applied. The AI's plan was to resolve this import/caching issue, potentially by restarting the Expo service.
2.  ****: This error appeared in  at line 60, where the  prop of  component was trying to import  which does not exist.

The AI engineer has identified both issues and plans to address them simultaneously by first removing the problematic logo requirement from  and then re-evaluating the  import/usage.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Remove the  requirement from  and re-verify the  import and usage in , then restart the Expo service.
